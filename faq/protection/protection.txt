**__FAQ__**

__**Q: Is Protection viable for end-game M+ / raid progression?**__
**A:** Yes. It absolutely is, we arent particularily popular right now but perfectly capable of doing keys up to the highest of levels. We are very strong defensively if played correctly, particularly in situations where the majority of the damage is blockable. Regradless of that, what tank you play isn't going to dictate your overall success. Tank balance right now is in a decent spot and the minor differences between the different tank specs won't make a difference for most. What matters is your individual skill and how familiar you are with a particular spec.
