__**Q: I want a bis list!**__
**A:**
BiS lists are a thing of the past because of the RNG of Vault and depending on how much of the raid you can clear on mythic.
The only notable things that are listable are as follows:
- *Any 450 pieces from raid*
- **[Treemouth's Festering Splinter]** from Brackenhide Hollow
- **[Beacon to the Beyond], [Elementium Pocket Anvil], [Zaqali Chaos Grapnel]** (offensive ST trinkets) and **[Neltharion's Call to Chaos]** **[Ominous Chromatic Essence]** (offensive aoe trinkets) from Abberus
- any ilvl upgrade

__**Q: Which dungeons should i play Spellblock?**__
**A:**
- Neltharus and Uldaman
Most keys have little to no magic dmg aimed at the tank so Spellblock is hardly useful outside of those 2 Keys. Halls of Infusion it *can* potentially be somewhat useful on the section between 2nd and 3rd boss around the heavy caster area, but outside of that theres not alot going on either. Same goes for Brackenhide
The Talent to drop to get Spellblock is Bloodsurge. It's the easiest point to drop without impacting actual performance.

__**Q: Brutal Vitality or Fueled by Violence?**__
**A:**
Both Talents scale equally well depending on target count. Both are fairly interchangable so you can't go wrong with either.
Generally BrV is preferred as it helps to maintain Ignore Pain in high pressure situation and low target count but isn't always active.
