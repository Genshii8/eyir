**Q:** How much of <insert stat here> do I need? How do my stats look?
**A:** You do not need a certain amount of any particular stat, nor do you need or want a certain distribution of stats. You simply want the most amount of total stats possible. That means going for item level.

Your gear and stats are a lot less meaningful to tanking than your actual play. So, if you're struggling on appropriately geared content, it's because you are playing poorly. Read the guide, learn the spec, and learn to make your own decisions.

**Q:** Iâ€™m having trouble keeping aggro on enemies, why is that?
**A:** Make sure you're using your damaging cooldowns like Avatar as often as possible while also following the proper ability priority order. Protection has solid damage output and as a result threat should not be a issue. If you are having threat issues you are likely making mistakes.

**Q:** What Legendary should I use for Raids / Mythic+?
**A:** For raids you should use The Wall for the increased Rage generation and Shield Wall reduction together with your Covenant Legendary. For Mythic+ you should be mainly looking to use Reprisal together with your Covenant Legendary. Both of these legendaries can be alternatives to eachother in Raids/Mythic+.

**Q:** What is the best Covenant choice?
**A:** All of the 4 Covenants are completely viable for Protection Warriors. 
For general purposes the order would be Kyrian = Night Fae >= Necrolord >> Venthyr.
Kyrian, Night Fae and Necrolord are really close to eachother in power once you obtain two Legendaries and the tier set.
