A more complete list here - <https://bloodmallet.com/index.html#warrior_arms?data_view=azerite_traits&type=trait_stacking&tier=3>

__How/Which traits stack?__
Striking the Anvil - Only the Overpower Damage .
Crushing Assault -  Only the Slam damage.
Test of Might - Strength bonus does stack.
Lord of War - CS/WB Damage stacks, not the rage gained.
Seismic Wave - Damage Stacks.
Gathering Storm - Strength Stacks.

__With only 1 Test of Might trait, do I still delay Bladestorm till the Test of Might Window?__
Yes, even with 1 trait only it's still worth to delay Bladestorm. On Burst AoE it's fine to ignore the ToM trait.

__When do we use the Crushing Assault proc?__
 Before Execute you'd use it like you're just casting Slam. In Execute you want to use it procs.

**Stats FAQ**

__What is the general stat priority?__
Haste > Crit > Strength > Versatility > Mastery
**THIS CAN VARY FROM CHARACTER TO CHARACTER PLEASE SIM FOR MORE ACCURATE WEIGHTS**

__Are there any breakpoints we need to aim for?__
No, there are tons of breakpoints that are not impactful outside of a sim. Keep getting more Haste and Crit.
