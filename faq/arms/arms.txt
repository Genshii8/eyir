__**FAQ**__ 

__**FOR THE MOST ACCURATE ANSWER TO ANY QUESTIONS, ALWAYS SIM YOURSELF**__

**Q**: Should I be in Arms Lootspec?

**Q**: What can I use Spell Reflect on?
**A**: This google doc sheet shows what you can and can't reflect. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS26lkSc_eaulHX7-UY8Uu-7DAHvkScxh3npd0kQn3uvvWsgsQm9ducLUi4R2mb7ieNluVilyq5sQe5/pubhtml#>.

**Q**: Is Mortal Strike used in the Execute phase?
**A**: Yes. If you have Executioner's Precision talented, you will Mortal strike at 2 stacks. If you are playing any version of the bladestorm build or don't have Juggernaut talented, you will cast Mortal Strike on cooldown. 

**Q**: Do I wait for 40 rage to cast Execute?
**A**: No, you want to use Execute at any rage, the DPR scales linearly. That being said sometimes casting Overpower when under 40 rage may be better for long term rage economy. 

**Q**: Do Shattering/Wrecking Throw have any use in PVE?
**A**: Yes! Wrecking Throw has a 500% modifier vs absorb shields and has a relatively low cooldown making it very useful for shields such as during Raszageth and Ruby Life Pools.
