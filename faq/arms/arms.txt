__**Q: Is Mortal Strike used in the Execute phase?**__
**A**: Yes. If you have Executioner's Precision talented, you will Mortal strike at 2 stacks. If you are playing any version of the bladestorm build or don't have Juggernaut talented, you will cast Mortal Strike on cooldown. 

__**Q: Do I wait for 40 rage to cast Execute?**__
**A**: No, you want to use Execute at any rage, the DPR scales linearly. That being said sometimes casting Overpower when under 40 rage may be better for long term rage economy.
