**Q**: What should I craft with my spark?
**A**: Embellished items (see below), Weapon, Ring(s) and generally filling low ilevel non-tier slots.

**Q**: What Embellishments are best?
**A**: Elemental Lariat > Allied Wristguards of Companionship/Frostfire Legguards of Preparation
    Unstable Frostfire Belt is competitive with wrists, potentially even better depending on your specific gear, though it is a purely single target effect and a DoT, which means you won't always get full value. The only place it's really better is to proc raid rings, making it a strong early craft, though it still isn't technically part of the absolute BiS setup.
