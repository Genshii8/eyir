**__FAQ__**

**Q**: Should I play Arms or Fury for arena?
**A**: Arms is currently one of the best melees for competitive PvP, while fury is unfortunately among the weakest. 

**Q**: How do I simulate my character for PvP?
**A**: You cannot simulate for PvP, the nature of PvP is too dynamic and have too many variables to be able to produce any useable results.

**Q**: Can I play double dps as warrior in 2v2?

       It's heavily recommended to play with a healer.
       Ret+arms and enh+arms can see some form of success at higher skill levels.
