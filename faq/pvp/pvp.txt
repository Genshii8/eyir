**__FAQ__**

**Q**: Should I play Arms or Fury for arena?
**A**: Arms is currently one of the best melees for competitive PvP, while fury is unfortunately among the weakest. 

**Q**: What is best covenant for PvP?
**A**: Kyrian pulls out ahead with Elysian Might and the general best choice for all brackets.
       Kyrian >= Venthyr >= Necrolord > Night Fae

**Q**: What is the best legendary?
**A**:
       Elysian Might = Best legendary to use as Kyrian
       Misshapen Mirror = Good vs magic setup comps like hunters and mages
       Exploiter = Go to legendary for Venthyr warriors
       Battlelord / Enduring Blow = Both are fine and act as the best damage option for Necrolord and Night Fae.

**Q**: What are the stats I should go for?
**A**: Versatility > Critical Strike > Mastery >= Haste
       Battlelord and Enduring Blow users can optimise for more haste if they see fit.

**Q**: I have reason to stick with another covenant/legendary, will this prevent me from reaching my rating goals?
**A**: You can reach at least gladiator with any covenant as arms, and obtain the elite set as both arms and fury with any covenant.

**Q**: How do I simulate my character for PvP?
**A**: You cannot simulate for PvP, the nature of PvP is too dynamic and have too many variables to be able to produce any useable results.
