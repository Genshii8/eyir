**Q**: Can I play double dps as warrior in 2v2?
**A**: Ideally, double dps comps requires a lot of crowd control and great sustained healing, something which warrior  doesn't have.
       It's heavily recommended to play with a healer.
       Ret+arms and enh+arms can see some form of success at higher skill levels.

**Q**: What healers should I play with in 2v2?
**A**: Resto sham and resto druid are currently the best healers.

**Q**: What compositions are currently the best for 3v3?
**A**: Turbo cleave / WMP(ala) / Ret+arms / WW+arms / Arms+SP+Rsham / TSG
       
       
**Q**: I can't find any PvP content on Youtube, what resources do I have available?
