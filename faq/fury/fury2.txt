**Q:** What are the best talents?
**A:** ST: Sudden Death, Massacre as Venthyr/Frenzy as non-Venthyr, Cruelty, Dragon Roar, Reckless Abandon
M+ Talents: Fresh Meat, Massacre, Cruelty, Bladestorm, Anger Management

**Q:** Should I be enraged before using Recklessness if I have Signet?
**A:** Yes, try and get enraged before using Recklessness. With Elysian Might and Signet, press recklessness immediately after throwing your Spear of Bastion, so you can potentially gain the bonus damage on your spear from Avatar. If you have Signet, try and use Recklessness during your GCD downtime after a Rampage/Fresh Meat Bloodthirst. This is because even if you are in a GCD, if Reck procs Bladestorm it will still trigger and you lose nothing, and your GCD downtime is being eaten by the Bladestorm. 

**Q:** Do I cancel Bladestorm on Single Target if Signet procs it?
**A:** You want to cancel Bladestorm, both the proc and natural cast, on Single Target if you are in an Execute phase with Massacre talented or are Venthyr. You cancel if you can Rampage or can Condemn. Bladestorm should not be canceled in AoE.
