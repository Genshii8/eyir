**Legendaries**: **Deathmaker** (Back) is the reccomended legendary for most raid encounters. It is the standard single target legendary. **Signet of Tormented Kings** is recomended for AoE heavy raid fights and Mythic+. 
Unity should be crafted on wrists, or your worst slot that doesn't compete with tier. 
Legendaries should be crafted with haste/mastery.

**Covenants**: <:Spear:742631092711981106> **Kyrian** is the best overall PvE covenant. It is the best covenant in Mythic+ and most raid encounters. <:Aftershock:742631092326236282> **Night Fae** is even with Kyrian on single target, but worse on AoE. <:condemn:742631092279967785> **Venthyr** is the best covenant for single target, however in practice it performs lower than the other covenants due to the strict uptime requirements of it's covenant legendary.
